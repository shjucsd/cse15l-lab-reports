1. Log into ieng6 - I entered the whole command of ssh without copying/pasting it from anywhere: `ssh cs15lsp23cj@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and then pressed <enter>. 
Since I had created a ssh key for it, I didn't have to type in my password. It directly logged in.
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account - I copied (Ctrl - C) the link of the fork and pasted (Ctrl - V) into the command line after typing `git clone`
and then pressed <enter>
3.

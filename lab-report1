#Steps to login to CSE15L specific account

1. Installing VScode
* I had already installed VS code on my device during CSE8B last quarter. I went to the Visual Studio Code website [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
* On the website, I clicked on the **Download** option on the top of the page. From there, you will have different options to install VScode depending on your
operating system. I used the option for Windows operating system.
* After the .exe file is downloaded, we need to execute it which opens the Installation Wizard for VScode. I generally clicked 'Next' for all the steps and finished the setup.
* Now you can open the VScode application. It should look similar to the following image.

# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands

## Command Line Options with `grep`

## 1. `grep -i`

* **Example 1**

```
$ grep -i "evidence" technical/biomed/ar68.txt
```
```
       Evidence in support of T-cell involvement in rheumatoid
          evidence for cellular activation (either selective or
```
* **Example 2**

```
$ grep -i "MacRo" technical/biomed/ar79.txt
```
```
        In the joint, MMP-9 is expressed in macrophages in the
        macrophages and vascular structures have previously
```

`grep -i` option ignores the case of the specified pattern while searching for it in the file. It is useful in case we want to see the number of lines which contain the pattern irrespective of the case.

## 2. `grep -w`

* **Example 1** 

```
$ grep -w "population" technical/biomed/ar140.txt
```
```
        represent an uncommitted precursor population, from which
        the effector population. We have previously demonstrated
        population.
        is restricted to the CD4 +, CD27 -population (Davis L,
        from the memory T-cell population before priming in the
        the initial memory cell population. Recent studies [ 32]
        synovial tissue T cells are a mixed population of recently
```

* **Example 2**

```
$ grep -w "mono" technical/biomed/rr74.txt
```
```
          for 45 min at 37°C (1:1500 anti-eNOS mono [BD
          Golden, CO, USA]; and 1:1500 anti-β-actin mono [Sigma
```

`grep -w` option searches for the exact word specified in the command line instead of treating it as a pattern, so it only prints the sentences which contain that whole word. It is useful because it is not always the case that we have to searcg for a pattern. This option with grep can be used to check the lines which contain exactly the same word we want.

## 3. `grep -v`

* **Example 1** 

```
$ grep -v "a" technical/government/Media/Farm_workers.txt
```

```

```

`grep -v` stands for the invert option which can be used to print the lines which don't contain the specified pattern. This option can be useful in a case where we would want to ensure that there is a specific pattern in every line. Hence, this option lets us check which lines won't have that pattern so that we can do the needful for our desired task.

## 4. `grep -c`

* **Example 1**

```
$ grep -c "we" technical/911report/preface.txt
29
```

* **Example 2** 

```
$ grep -c "in" technical/plos/pmed.0020088.txt
58
```

`grep -c` option returns the count of the lines which contain the specified pattern. This option can be useful in cases we just want to check how many lines contain that pattern. Hence, this provides a good alternative of `wc` command where we first need to redirect the output of `grep` into another file. Using this option, we can directly print out the count of lines.
